# gCFA App

Allows users to deposit cEUR to get gCFA.

You give it cEUR (on Celo Mainnet), and you'll get gCFA. Give it gCFA, and you get your cEUR back. The rate is fixed (655.957 gCFA per cEUR) and cannot be changed.

The gCFA is directly pegged to the cEUR. 1 EURe = 655.957 gCFA, and 1000 gCFA = 1.53 cEUR.
