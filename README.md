# gCFA App

Allows you to get gCFA.

You give it EURe (on Gnosischain Mainnet), and you'll get gCFA. Give it gCFA, and you get your EURe back. The rate is fixed (655.957 gCFA per EURe) and cannot be changed.

## Motivation

The goal is build an interface for gCFA. The most common functions are accessible to anyone: deposit, withdraw, and transfer.

The gCFA on Gnosis is directly pegged to the EURe. 1 EURe = 655.957 gCFA, and 1000 gCFA = 1.53 EURe.
